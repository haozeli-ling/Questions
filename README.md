# Semantics of questions 

## Description
In the standard semantic theory, the meaning of a sentence is identified with its truth condition. Pinning down the meaning of questions, however, challenges this standard view as questions do not have a truth condition. It does not make much sense to say that a question is true or false. Since the 1970s, many approaches have been developed to capture the meaning of questions, leading to theoretical innovations as well as an impressive growth of the empircal domain. This seminar aims to provide an overview of the theoretical and empirical landscape of question meaning, with an emphasis on the following topics: 

- three classical approaches to question meaning (categorial meaning, propositional set, partition semantics),
- composition of question meaning,
- semantics of embedded questions,
- the pragmatics of questions, 
- cross-linguistic variations in questions

# Seminar on questions 

## Description
In the standard semantic theory, the meaning of a sentence is identified with its truth condition. Pinning down the meaning of questions, however, poses challenges to this standard view as questions do not have a truth condition. It does not make much sense to say that a question is true or false. Since the 1970s, many approaches have been developed to capture the meaning of questions, leading to theoretical innovations as well as an impressive growth of the empirical domain.  

This seminar will begin with the classical question semantics of the 70s and 80s, emphasizing the connection among different approaches. Afterwards, we will discuss a series of cross-linguistic phenomena that motivate theories interweaving question semantics with other meaning modules (e.g., focus, modality, dynamics). Finally, we will consider the pragmatics of questions in a dynamic framework, which provides tools for understanding the discourse function of interrogative sentences. 

## Time and place
Tuesday and Thursday 1:30 pm -- 3:05 pm, Stevenson Lib (aka. the Cave)

## Tentative schedule
### Unit 1: Classic approaches
- Sept 22. The categorial approach. 
  - Reading: [Xiang (2021)](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s10988-020-09294-8?author_access_token=UVxHhIvlJBVo_alvFGAeVPe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY7FxemtbOlymEGL01JT1uHiyhbh2qg_2XP2XH0z56Sl1WPyTYGJB_2J569xCWskCfG3bSwxMd6O6yZUa5YxlYtQvb5wN8T7FdckKz46ZcUnzQ%3D%3D)
    - In the categorial approach, the meaning of a question is defined in terms of its possible short answers. Although this approach has been confronted with many challenges in the past decades, this paper presents new evidence to show the necessity of defining questions in their short answers. Moreover, it provides a hybrid categorial approach to overcome the previous challenges. 
  - Lecture notes (coming soon)

## Resourses

This seminar will not and cannot cover all the fasinating topics relating to questions, unfortunately. However, fortunately, there have been several wonderful recent seminars on question semantics and their course materials are accessible online. You may find it useful to consult them:

- [Patrick Elliott, Kai von Fintel, Danny Fox, Sabine Iatridou, and David Pesetsky](https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/7282): Syntax and semantics of questions (Class videos are also available)  
- [Yimei Xiang](https://yimeixiang.wordpress.com/teaching/): Semantics of questions (a detailed introduction of the categorial approach, uniqueness, mention-some readings, higher-order answers)
- [Floris Roelofsen](https://projects.illc.uva.nl/inquisitivesemantics/courses/2018-creteling.html): Semantics of questions (based on Inquisitive Semantics)

Veneeta Dayal has a great book [*Questions* (2017)](https://global.oup.com/ukhe/product/questions-9780199281275?cc=us&lang=en&), which includes almost everything about questions.

# Semantics of questions 

## Description
In the standard semantic theory, the meaning of a sentence is identified with its truth condition. Pinning down the meaning of questions, however, challenges this standard view as questions do not have a truth condition. It does not make much sense to say that a question is true or false. Since the 1970s, many approaches have been developed to capture the meaning of questions, leading to theoretical innovations as well as an impressive growth of the empircal domain. Currently, the empirical coverage is even beyond interrogative sentences and the relevant theories are created by combining semantics of questions with other semantic frameworks. 

This seminar will begin with the classic question semantics of the 70s and 80s, emphasizing the connection among different approaches. Afterwards, it will discuss a series of cross-linguistic phenomena that motivate theories interweaving the module of question meaning with other meaning modules (e.g., focus, modality, dynamics). Finally, it will consider the dynamic pragmatics of questions, which provides tools for understanding the discourse function of interrogative sentences.

## Resourses

This seminar cannot cover all the fasinating topics relating to questions, unfortunately. However, fortunately, there have been several wonderful seminars on question semantics that have been taught recently and their course materials are accessible from the internet. You may find your favorite topic(s) from there:

- Patrick Elliott, Kai von Final, Danny Fox, Sabine Iatridou, and David Pesetsky: Syntax and semantics of questions (Class videos are also available)  
- Yimei Xiang: Semantics of questions 
- Floris Roelofsen: Semantics of questions (more on Inquisitive Semantics)

# Semantics of questions 

In the standard semantic theory, the meaning of a sentence is identified with its truth condition. Pinning down the meaning of questions challenges this standard view, as questions, unlike declarative sentences, cannot be assigned a truth value. It does not make much sense to say that a question is true or false. Since 1970s, many approaches have been proposed to capture the meaning of questions and, at the same time, many issues have also been raised. In this class, we will include the following issues that lie at the heart of the investigation of question meaning. 
- three classical approaches to question meaning (categorial meaning, propositional set, partition semantics),
- composition of question meaning,
- semantics of embedded questions,
- the dynamic pragmatics of questions, 
- cross-linguistic variations of questions and their influence on our theories of a unified semantics of questions.
